I've spent approximately one week to complete this simple game. This project was originally designed purely to test and explore my Python Pygame coding skills.

Later I found great interest in coding Pygame, so I've pushed myself further, then within a week or so, I've made this game. I wouldn't consider it as perfect, but it was not bad.

I'm 15 at the time I created this game.

Here are the controls:
WASD to move
SPACE BAR to shoot (It's recommended to hold space bar instead of spamming) - Additionally, you could hold LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, arrow keys to control your aim.

Key features of the game:
- Heal Block: It heals you and the ally block
- Obstacle Block: Fires bullets and you take damage upon impact
- Ally Block: A block that orbits around the player. It has a defense mechanism which will:
- 1. Dash toward the bullet and take damage for the player if it gets too close to them.
  2. Dash toward the Obstacle block if the distance between the block and player is too close.
- Boss Fights:
- 1. Boss Block: The block that needs to be defeated in order for boss fight to end
  2. Minion block: Orbits around the boss block. It is respawnable and can fire bullets
  3. The obstacle block will now form a Blitzkrieg Formation and fire bullets, the player will need to try and penetrate the formation
  4. Notes: I do not support Nazism in any way, I used the Blitzkrieg tactic purely just for coolness
